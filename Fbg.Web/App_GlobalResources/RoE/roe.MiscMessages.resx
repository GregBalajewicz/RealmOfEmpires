    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

&lt;LI&gt;Creating or using an account for the sole purpose of aiding another account is strictly prohibited.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>: &lt;B&gt;Hey! I just invited you to my clan {0}&lt;/B&gt; in &lt;a href='http://apps.facebook.com/realmofempires/?ccid=2&amp;ccm=5'&gt;Realm Of Empires&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href='http://apps.facebook.com/realmofempires/?ccid=2&amp;ccm=5&amp;goto=clanoverview.aspx'&gt;&lt;B&gt;Accept&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href='http://apps.facebook.com/realmofempires/?ccid=2&amp;ccm=5&amp;goto=clanoverview.aspx'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reject&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the invitation. &lt;i&gt;Clan is a loose federation of players working together for their mutual glory!&lt;/i&gt;</value>

  <data name="SleepModeExplanation" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;div class="jaxHide" rel="How does it work?"&gt;
Sleep Mode allows you to prevent anyone from &lt;I&gt;launching&lt;/I&gt; attacks on your villages while the sleep mode is active - when you go to sleep, or otherwise cannot be at the computer&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;LI&gt;You can activate sleep mode for at most {1} hours in a &lt;b&gt;{0} hour&lt;/b&gt; period.
&lt;LI&gt;Once you activate the sleep mode, you have to wait &lt;b&gt;{2} min&lt;/b&gt; before it actually comes to effect (during which time player can still launch attacks at you)
&lt;LI&gt;Once the sleep mode goes into effect no one will be able to &lt;i&gt;launch&lt;/I&gt; an attack at you, during this time. Attacks launched and incoming before sleep mode is active will still land even during the sleep mode. &lt;B&gt;This is critical to understand&lt;/b&gt; : being in sleep mode only prevents more attacks from being launched at your villages; it does not prevent currently launched attacks from landing and causing demage.
&lt;LI&gt;You may cancel the sleep mode anytime BUT you lose the remaining time of protection and must wait until sleep mode is available again to use it again.
&lt;LI&gt;NOTE - Any attacks against you that are in progress will land, only new attacks will be prevented when sleep mode is enabled.&lt;/div&gt;</value>
